# Web-Scraping
12/15/20
So I am trying to learn the basic of Web-scraping but I did not know where to start. So I then decided to
try Web-scraping with something else I am trying to get into which are stocks.

What this python file does is asks for a bunch of ticker symbols. Once you have enterned in all of the desired ticker
just hit enter with an empty line and it will run. 

It will print out all of the prices for the ticker symbols that you have entered. If you entered in a ticker symbol that
does not exist or was typed in correctly it will print an error statement like this ticker symbol does not exist.

I am using marketwatch.com as the website I am getting these prices from.

The next thing I want to to with the project is like adding all the change it has from day to day and stuff

I also want to make it so it can go into like an excel sheet and I can just run a script and it can just give me the 
prices and the change it has had over the week and day to day

Learned a lot about how to edit Excel sheets with python and stuff like that and started to work with it and it 
seems to be pretty easy and the documentation is pretty easy to understand

I have got it so that it will iterate through all of the ticker symbols that I have on the sheet(must be spelled correctly)
and then it puts down the price of the stock aswell

I am really starting to enjoy coding a lot more, hopefully tomorrow I can make it so it puts more data in like the
how much the stock has gone up since a day, week, or month
